Initial release of a high-level avif decoder.

This crate is not really usable. Until I determine
a useful high-level API, you may want to use the unstable
API in [`libavif-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/libavif-sys)
or the utility functions for [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image),
[`libavif-image`](https://crates.io/crates/libavif-image).
